This C program, named "100-elf_header.c," analyzes and displays information contained in the ELF header at the start of an ELF file.

Here are explanations for the main components and functions within the code:

Headers and Includes:

The code begins with necessary header file inclusions like <elf.h>, <sys/types.h>, <sys/stat.h>, <fcntl.h>, <unistd.h>, <stdio.h>, and <stdlib.h>. These provide the required libraries and functions for the program.
Function Declarations:

Several functions are declared in this section, including check_elf, print_magic, print_class, print_data, print_version, print_abi, print_osabi, print_type, print_entry, and close_elf. Each function has a specific purpose in analyzing and printing ELF header information.
Function Definitions:

The code includes the definitions for each of the functions mentioned earlier. These functions are responsible for extracting and printing various elements of the ELF header, such as the magic numbers, class, data format, version, OS/ABI, ABI version, type, and entry point address.
check_elf:

This function checks if the given file is an ELF file by verifying the first four bytes of the ELF magic numbers.
print_magic:

This function prints the magic numbers of the ELF header, separated by spaces.
print_class:

It prints the class of the ELF header, indicating whether it's 32-bit or 64-bit.
print_data:

This function prints the data format, specifying whether it's 2's complement, little-endian, or big-endian.
print_version:

It prints the version of the ELF header, including the current version.
print_abi:

This function prints the OS/ABI (Operating System/Application Binary Interface) of the ELF header.
print_osabi:

It prints the ABI version of the ELF header.
print_type:

This function prints the type of the ELF file, indicating whether it's a relocatable file, an executable file, a shared object file, or a core file.
print_entry:

It prints the entry point address of the ELF file.
close_elf:

This function is used to close the ELF file. If the file cannot be closed, it reports an error and exits with code 98.
main:

The main function is where the program execution begins. It handles the command-line arguments and opens the ELF file specified as an argument.
It reads the ELF header information and then calls the various functions to display the ELF header information.
If any error occurs, it prints an appropriate error message to stderr and exits with code 98.
The code is documented with comments to provide clarity about each function's purpose and the program's overall structure.

This program reads the ELF header from an ELF file and prints various details about the header's content, including the ELF type, class, data format, and more. If the input file is not a valid ELF file or any errors occur, it exits with a status code of 98.
